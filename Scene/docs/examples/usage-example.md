# Example: Detecting and Splitting Scenes in Movie Clip

As a concrete example to become familiar with PySceneDetect, let's use the following short clip from the James Bond movie, GoldenEye (Copyright &copy; 1995 MGM):

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMgIPnCnlbQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMgIPnCnlbQ)

You can [download the clip from here](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/raw/resources/tests/goldeneye/goldeneye.mp4) (may have to right-click and save-as, put the video in your working directory as `goldeneye.mp4`).  We will first demonstrate using the default parameters, then how to find the optimal threshold/sensitivity for a given video, and lastly, using the PySceneDetect output to split the video into individual scenes/clips.


## Content-Aware Detection with Default Parameters

In this case, we want to split this clip up into each individual scene - at each location where a fast cut occurs.  This means we need to use content-aware detecton mode (`-d content`).  Using the following command, let's run PySceneDetect on the video using the default threshold/sensitivity:

```rst
scenedetect -i goldeneye.mp4 -o scenes_list.csv -d content -si -df 4
```

The `-si` flag is to save a thumbnail/preview image of each scene, and `-df 4` downscales the video internally, by a factor of 4, to improve detection performance.  Assuming the other paramters are left at the default values, the following scenes should be obtained:

Note that this is *almost* perfect - however, one of the scene cuts/breaks in scene 17 was not detected.  We will now generate a statistics file for the `goldeneye.mp4` video to determine the optimal detection threshold (`-t 27` ends up being the optimal value for `goldeneye.mp4` when using `-d content`, versus the default value of `30`).  Finally, we will use the output from PySceneDetect to split the original video into individual files/clips.


## Finding Optimal Threshold/Sensitivity Value

We now know that a threshold of `30` does not work in all cases for our video, as per scene 17 detected above (note the last image is from a different scene):

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/resources/tests/goldeneye/d-content-t-30/ge-scene-17.jpg" width="720" /> 

We can determine the proper threshold in this case by generating a statistics file (`-s` / `--statsfile`) for the video `goldeneye.mp4`, and looking at the behaviour of the values where we expect the scene break/cut to occur in scene 17.

Finally, our updated scene list appears as follows (similar entries skipped for brevity):


|   Scene #    |  Start Time   |    Preview    |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
|     ...      |      ...      |     ...       |
|      16      |  00:00:04.144 | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/resources/tests/goldeneye/d-content-t-27/ge-scene-16.jpg" width="480" />  |
|      17      |  00:00:04.144 | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/resources/tests/goldeneye/d-content-t-27/ge-scene-17.jpg" width="480" />  |
|      18      |  00:00:04.144 | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/resources/tests/goldeneye/d-content-t-27/ge-scene-18.jpg" width="480" />  |
|      19      |  00:00:04.144 | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/resources/tests/goldeneye/d-content-t-27/ge-scene-19.jpg" width="480" />  |
|      20      |  00:00:04.144 | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/resources/tests/goldeneye/d-content-t-27/ge-scene-20.jpg" width="480" />  |
|      21      |  00:00:04.144 | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect/resources/tests/goldeneye/d-content-t-27/ge-scene-21.jpg" width="480" />  |


Now the missing scene (scene number 18, in this case) has been detected properly, and our scene list is larger now due to the added cuts.


## Splitting/Cutting Video into Clips

The last step to automatically split the input file into clips is to specify the `-o` / `--output` option.  This will pass a list of the detected scene timecodes to `mkvmerge`, if installed, splitting the input video into scenes.  To generate a sequence of files `goldeneye-scene-001.mkv`, `goldeneye-scene-002.mkv`, `goldeneye-scene-003.mkv`..., our full command becomes:

```rst
scenedetect -i goldeneye.mp4 -o scenes_list.csv -d content -si -df 4 -o goldeneye-scene.mkv
```

The scene number `-001` will be added to the output filename automatically.

Note that this method of splitting doesn't perform any re-encoding or modification of the original video/audio streams, and thus sometimes may not be time-accurate (see the [mkvmerge documentation]([this section](https://mkvtoolnix.download/doc/mkvmerge.html#mkvmerge.description.split) for details).  The video is simply remuxed, with no changes to the original codec or video/audio streams.  Essentially, PySceneDetect calls the following command when an output file is specified:

    mkvmerge -o output_file.mkv --split timecodes:00:45:00.000,01:20:00.250,[...] input_file.avi

See [this section](https://mkvtoolnix.download/doc/mkvmerge.html#mkvmerge.description.split) of the mkvmerge docs for more information on the `--split` flag.  If using `mkvtoolnix-gui`, simply add the video in the input section, and in the "File Splitting" options, select the timecode option, and copy-and-paste the timecode list from the PySceneDetect output.  This will split the output video at those timecodes during muxing.

If the actual scene boundaries in the output files are too heavily skewed from the detected timecodes, you may want to consider using an external tool to actually re-encode the input video (e.g. `ffmpeg`), and use the timecode list obtained from the PySceneDetect output to indicate the start/end times of each output file.
