<h3><span class="fa wy-text-warning"></span>&nbsp; Note that the Python API is undergoing major changes.</h3>
This documentation refers to the API as of PySceneDetect v0.3.x and before (corresponding to the older version on pip).  You can also see the Github releases page to download a specific version of PySceneDetect.  The next major release (v0.5) will include a stable API with a much more intuitive workflow for Python users while retaining full command-line usability as a front-end program.

# PySceneDetect Python Interface

In addition to being used from the command line, or through the GUI, PySceneDetect can be used in Python directly - allowing easy integration into other applications/scripts, or interactive use through a Python REPL/notebook.


## Simple Example

The below code sample shows the general usage style of how to detect scenes using PySceneDetect and custom Python code.  The end result is three separate lists:  `scene_list`, `scene_list_msec`, and `scene_list_tc`, all containing the detected scene breaks/cuts in different formats (frame #, milliseconds, and timecode string in `HH:MM:SS.nnn` format, respectively).

```python
import scenedetect

scene_list = []        # Scenes will be added to this list in detect_scenes().
path = 'my_video.mp4'  # Path to video file.

# Usually use one detector, but multiple can be used.
detector_list = [
    scenedetect.detectors.ThresholdDetector(threshold = 16, min_percent = 0.9)
]

video_framerate, frames_read = scenedetect.detect_scenes_file(
    path, scene_list, detector_list)

# scene_list now contains the frame numbers of scene boundaries.
print scene_list

# create new list with scene boundaries in milliseconds instead of frame #.
scene_list_msec = [(1000.0 * x) / float(video_fps) for x in scene_list]

# create new list with scene boundaries in timecode strings ("HH:MM:SS.nnn").
scene_list_tc = [scenedetect.timecodes.get_string(x) for x in scene_list_msec]
```


## Scene Detection in a Python REPL

PySceneDetect can be used interactively as well.  One way to get familiar with this is to type the above example into a Python REPL line by line, viewing the output as you run through the code and making sure you understand the output/results.  In the future, functions may be added to preview the scene boundaries graphically using OpenCV's GUI functionality, to allow interactive use of PySceneDetect from the command-line without launching the full GUI.
